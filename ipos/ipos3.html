    I possess no specialized knowledge of architecture, but I understand
    <br>
    that in the Gothic cathedral of the West, the roof is thrust up and up so as 
    <br>
    to&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspplace its pinnacle as high in the heavens as possible-and that herein is thought&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspto 
    <br>
    lie its special beauty. In the temples of Japan, on the other hand, a roof of heavy tiles is first laid out, and in the 
    <br>
    deep, spacious shadows created by the eaves the rest of the structure is built. Nor is this true only of temples; 
    <br>
    in the palaces of the nobility and the houses of the common people, what first strikes the eye is the mas-
    <br>
    sive roof of tile or thatch and the heavy darkness that hangs beneath the eaves. Even at midday cav-
    <br>
    ernous darkness spreads over all beneath the roof's edge, making entryway, doors, walls, and pi-  
    <br>
    llars all but invisible. The grand temples of Kyoto-Chion'in, Honganji-and the farmhouses
    <br>
    of the remote countryside are alike in this respect: like most buildings of the past their
    <br>
    roofs give the impression of possessing far greater weight, height, and surface 
    <br>
    than all that stands beneath the eaves. In making for ourselves a place to live, we first 
    <br>
    spread a parasol to throw a shadow on the earth, and in the pale light of the shadow we 
    <br>
    put together a house. There are of course roofs on Western houses too, but they 
    <br>
    are less to keep off the sun than to keep off the wind and the dew; even from without it is apparent that they are 
    <br>
    built to create as few shadows as possible and to expose the interior to as much light as possible. If the roof of a Japanese house
    <br>
    is a parasol, the roof of a Western house is no more than a cap, with as small a visor as possible so as to allow the sunlight to 
    <br>
    penetrate directly beneath the eaves. There are no doubt all sorts of reasons-climate,
    <br>
    building materials-for the deep Japanese eaves. The fact that we did not use glass, concrete, and bricks, 
    <br>
    for instance, made a low roof necessary to keep off the driving wind and rain. A light room would 
    <br>
    no doubt have been more convenient for us, too, than a dark room. The quality 
    <br>
    that we call beauty, however, must always grow from the realities of life, and our 
    <br>
    ancestors, forced to live in dark rooms, presently came to discover beauty
    <br>
    in shadows, ultimately to guide shadows towards beauty's ends.And so 
    <br>
    it has come to be that the beauty of a Japanese room depends on 
    <br>
    a variation of shadows, heavy shadows against light shadows-it ha-
    <br>
    s nothing else. Westerners are amazed at the simplicity of Japanese 
    <br>
    rooms, perceiving in them no more than ashen walls bereft of orna. 
    <br>
    Their reaction is understandable, but it betrays a failure to compreh
    <br>
    the mystery of shadows. Out beyond the sitting room, which the rays
    <br>
    of the sun can at best but barely reach,we extend the eaves or build on a veranda, putting the sunlight at still greater a remove.

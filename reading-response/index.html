        Lialina's statement of "There was a pre-existing environment; a structural, visual and acoustic culture you could play around with, a culture you could break. There was a world of options and one of the options was to be different." is concrete and inspiring to me. Designers need to have a knowledge bank of a variety of designs because as trends loop, the old or eliminated aesthetic will also return. I became fixated on the examples Lialina offered, for instance the "under construction sign" and "starry night background," as she explained why the designer would integrate each component to their designs, how would they illustrate the ambiance and energy these aspects may bring.
After reading My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be? I agreed with Schwulst idea of "website helps form your own identity." I agreed that having a website can assist you in building your own identity. To illustrate what a website can be, Schwulst used a variety of poetic metaphors, including a room, a shelf, a plant, a garden, and a puddle. The website can be compared to a room as the metaphor I relate to the most. As individuals are the room's owners, they have the authority to determine what objects should remain inside because such items represent themselves and their interests. The website serves as the user's portal to the outside world. The website is the connection of how an individual connect to the world. They are free.

        Staples used this article to illustrate the development of technologies connected to typography and graphic design from the late 1970s through the 1990s. What you get is what you see is the printing skills introduced in 1984, the idea has then been used in web design, for example the interaction with different  icons. It is the first time I see the term WYSIWYG Without a doubt, the Adobe system is what makes graphic design popular. Because of the undeveloped technology available at the time, designers had to undertake several experiments and challenges to make a successful design. I couldn’t imagine how difficult was it for the designers to develop their design at that time, they’ve break the rules of traditional layout and format. The development of typography is currently being carried out in cyberspace through computer-modeled and algorithm-driven typography.

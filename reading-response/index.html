    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">Typography and Screen</span> by <span class="author">Loretta Staples</span></h2>

    <p>
        Lialina's statement of "There was a pre-existing environment; a structural, visual and acoustic culture you could play around with, a culture you could break. There was a world of options and one of the options was to be different." is concrete and inspiring to me. Designers need to have a knowledge bank of a variety of designs because as trends loop, the old or eliminated aesthetic will also return. I became fixated on the examples Lialina offered, for instance the "under construction sign" and "starry night background," as she explained why the designer would integrate each component to their designs, how would they illustrate the ambiance and energy these aspects may bring.
After reading My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be? I agreed with Schwulst idea of "website helps form your own identity." I agreed that having a website can assist you in building your own identity. To illustrate what a website can be, Schwulst used a variety of poetic metaphors, including a room, a shelf, a plant, a garden, and a puddle. The website can be compared to a room as the metaphor I relate to the most. As individuals are the room's owners, they have the authority to determine what objects should remain inside because such items represent themselves and their interests. The website serves as the user's portal to the outside world. The website is the connection of how an individual connect to the world. They are free.

        Staples used this article to illustrate the development of technologies connected to typography and graphic design from the late 1970s through the 1990s. What you get is what you see is the printing skills introduced in 1984, the idea has then been used in web design, for example the interaction with different  icons. It is the first time I see the term WYSIWYG Without a doubt, the Adobe system is what makes graphic design popular. Because of the undeveloped technology available at the time, designers had to undertake several experiments and challenges to make a successful design. I couldn’t imagine how difficult was it for the designers to develop their design at that time, they’ve break the rules of traditional layout and format. The development of typography is currently being carried out in cyberspace through computer-modeled and algorithm-driven typography.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title"> Function as narrative </span> by <span class="author">Weiyi Li</span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        The article explores the concept of "Function" in the context of manufacturing, highlighting its significance in projecting human needs onto objects. Function is essentially the purpose or mission of any product, and it serves as a catalyst for potential narratives to unfold. Just as in programming, where Function transforms chaos into order and simplicity into complexity, designers also value Function as a powerful tool for creating elegant and efficient stories within the realm of code. Considering the layout of different media carrying a website can greatly enhance the design process, as Function's ability to shape narratives extends beyond programming and into various design disciplines.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">Can the Internet be archived?</span> by <span class="author">Jill Lepore</span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        In the past, I believed the common notion that whatever is published on the internet will remain there indefinitely. However, I recently discovered that comments on websites can be deleted, which made me question why website owners or administrators do not exercise more control over the commenting process. If comments that are deemed stupid or inappropriate will be deleted anyway, does that mean the concept of free speech on the internet is misleading? Additionally, if the evidence or sources cited in an article are found on the internet and are likely to be deleted eventually, what is the purpose of including citations?
        Jill Lepore suggests the need to establish a digital equivalent of the Library of Congress, which I believe is crucial in today's world where online resources and information are ubiquitous. However, this proposal raises the issue of obtaining permissions and notifying site owners before archiving their content, which poses various political and legal challenges.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">The Web’s Grain</span> by <span class="author">Frank Chimero</span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        Chimero repeatedly emphasizes the importance of "responsive design" throughout the text. Responsive web design refers to the approach of designing websites that adapt and respond to different screen sizes and orientations. It involves dynamically altering the appearance of a website to ensure optimal viewing on various devices. Chimero emphasizes that it is crucial for designers to evolve their designs into responsive designs as they progress.

Chimero presents a thought-provoking idea: What if we changed our perception of the web from a blank canvas for painting to a material for building? He draws inspiration from artist David Hockney's work, which showcases an edgeless surface of unknown proportions. This surface consists of small, individual, and variable elements from multiple perspectives, coming together to form a coherent whole that captures a particular moment.

Chimero suggests a shift in approach, advocating for starting with the act of drawing and then defining the boundaries around it. The web, with its interconnected individual pages, offers an inherent edgelessness that allows its structure to expand infinitely. He encourages designers to break out of their comfort zones and explore new perspectives, urging them to be creative and envision websites beyond conventional boundaries.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">A Vernacular Web</span> by <span class="author">Olia Lialina</span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        Olia Lialina encourages designers to examine past designs to avoid inexperienced design choices. She has been actively creating artwork that highlights the vanishing aesthetics of the past, intending to apologize for her past arrogance and preserve the beauty of the vernacular web by incorporating it into contemporary art pieces. However, she acknowledges that this is only part of the task.

        Lialina cites the "Under Construction Sign" as a potent symbol of the early web. It evokes memories of the exciting times when scientists and engineers completed their work on the Information Highway, and ordinary people eagerly utilized their tools to construct their own roads and junctions. The web was filled with unfinished elements, broken links, and warnings of incomplete navigation.
        
        By referencing the "Under Construction Sign," Lialina underscores the significance of websites achieving a sense of authenticity and allows designers to visualize and rectify undesirable design aspects.
        
        In summary, Olia Lialina urges designers to learn from past designs to avoid inexperience. She seeks to integrate disappearing aesthetics of the past into contemporary art, apologizing for previous arrogance and preserving the beauty of the vernacular web. She highlights the importance of websites capturing authenticity and enables designers to better address undesirable design elements.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">The Internet’s Back-to-the-Land Movement</span> by <span class="author">Becca Abbe</span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        The article explores the emergence of the back-to-the-land movement in the 1970s, driven by concerns about the environment and sustainability, as people sought to live in a more sustainable and communal way and disconnect from mainstream society. This movement transitioned into digital utopianism, exemplified by the launch of the WELL in the 1980s, reflecting a desire for a different society and a critique of the dominant culture. Abbe's article explores the blending of digital convenience with a self-sufficient lifestyle, highlighting the internet's role as a vast knowledge source for sustainable practices. It connects like-minded individuals through online communities and social media, overcoming isolation, and supports small-scale farmers and artisans through e-commerce platforms. However, the article also raises concerns about the potential disconnect between virtual activism and tangible change, emphasizing the need to balance technology with a genuine connection to the physical world.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">Black Gooey Universe</span> by <span class="author">American Artist</span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        The article emphasizes the significance of a graphical user interface (GUI) in enhancing user-friendliness on websites. It acknowledges the initial versions of GUI, which introduced clickable interfaces, cursors, and basic computer mice. It suggests that websites with improved interfaces tend to possess greater commercial value.

Furthermore, the article discusses how GUI development in Silicon Valley has perpetuated inherent racial biases, particularly anti-blackness, within its technological products and processes. The creation of the gooey interface aimed to make computers more accessible, reducing the required knowledge to complete tasks. However, this also led to the establishment of the user/programmer dichotomy, shaping our understanding of users as distinct from programmers.

The article highlights the desire for a black screen, representing the aspiration to eliminate this dichotomy and create an interface devoid of subjection, without any distinction between users and programmers. It argues that contemporary computer interfaces evolved from the idea of a black interface, which transcends this dichotomy.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">The Adventures of an Avatar and Her Real Girl</span> by <span class="author">Helen Gregory</span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        In Helen Gregory's "The Adventures of an Avatar and Her Real Girl," Skawennati explores social issues, specifically the future of Indigenous communities, through her innovative use of a digital avatar named xox. By embodying xox, Skawennati encourages Indigenous individuals to envision their role in shaping society and challenges prevailing perceptions. Through a unique combination of Indigenous storytelling, futurism, and digital media like virtual reality and video games, Skawennati empowers Indigenous communities to reclaim their narratives and imagine a more inclusive future. xox serves as a symbol of resistance and empowerment, raising questions about cultural authenticity and offering glimpses of a better world. Skawennati's work stimulates contemplation on self-expression and cultural representation in the digital realm, while also inspiring fellow artists and designers to integrate their own backgrounds and cultures, thereby amplifying the experiences of underrepresented communities.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">Run your own social</span> by <span class="author">Darius Kazemi</span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        The article serves as a guide for individuals interested in establishing a social network within a small community, where the benefits of a more intimate and specific network outweigh the need for a larger user base. This smaller community size allows for informal decision-making processes and enables the site to be managed as a hobby or a low-intensity community project rather than a full-time job. However, one challenge highlighted in the article is that users on Friend Camp tend to be understanding when the site experiences downtime, even if it lasts for several hours while the site administrator is unavailable. This understanding can sometimes lead to users abandoning the site.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">The Hidden Life of an Amazon User</span> by <span class="author">Joana Moll</span></h2>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        Moll's project highlights the environmental impact of everyday activities, such as browsing e-commerce websites. While companies like Amazon offer personalized user experiences and fast delivery, their hidden codes consume a significant amount of energy, contributing to their carbon footprint. Despite the seemingly small impact of individual actions, consumers have the power to demand more sustainable practices from companies. Supporting sustainable companies can incentivize others to follow suit, but systemic change is necessary for addressing the issue at scale. This can be achieved through promoting sustainable practices, regulating energy consumption, and encouraging companies to invest in renewable energy sources and energy-efficient technologies to reduce their carbon footprint.

    <time></time>
    <p>
    The article highlights the issue of unequal distribution of power and data due to unethical and biased perspectives of researchers. It also discusses the efforts of DGEI and Angwin to address these issues. The article emphasizes the importance of the makers' identities, their proximity to the subject matter, the terms of their collaboration, and the project's leadership. This made me realize that while I have been focused on visualizing and displaying data, the most crucial aspect of data projects is collecting the right data to work with.
